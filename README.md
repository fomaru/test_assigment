Don't forget to insert the path to your driver!!!

I was using geckodriver 0.31

Comments on eldorado.ua only contain the date on which they were posted and not the exact time so dates in the resulting file containing all the comments have 00:00:00 as a placeholder for time.
 
The script works fine but is a little bit slow since it's collecting a lot of URLs as an overhead if you wanted to collect more than 3 items per category. Just increase the index value delimiter in reviews_per_sub_category to do so.

Thx, Alexei
